# Deep-Learning_Hw1

This repository contains homework assignments related to Deep Learning. All the files are Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files, which include Python code snippets and the corresponding results of executing the code sequentially. The files are focused on various deep learning tasks that I have worked on.

Instructions for Running the Code:
Ensure that Anaconda is installed, as it is required to use Jupyter Notebook.

After installing Anaconda, open the Anaconda Prompt and install PyTorch by running the following command:
-- conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch --

Once the installation is complete, open Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda, import the notebook files from this repository, and run the code.
